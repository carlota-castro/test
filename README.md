# ECONOMIC INCOME AND GROWTH
We will analyse the economic income and growth in each of the continents throughout the years <br/>
The data we will analyse can be found on: https://www.gapminder.org/data/ (Economy/Incomes & growth/GDP total,yearly growth)<br/>

**Visualisation ideas** <br/> 
•	Timeline of important historical events
•	Analyse how these historical events (eg. economic crises) had an impact on the GDP total, yearly growth
•	Geospatial analysis (where did the historical events had the most impact?)
•	Compare the GPD total, yearly growth per year in each continent
o	Analyse countries that have experienced the highest increases
o	Analyse countries that have experienced the lowest increases
•	Augment the data and include additional factors such as GDP/capita, GDP/employee, Income…
